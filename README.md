# developers

Make sure to align yourself with:
- [Code Guidelines](./guidelines/Contributing.md)

### Basics
- "Is this company taking over the world?" but rather "How big could this company become if the founders did the right things?"
- If you have 100 users, you need to get 10 more next week to grow 10% weekly. And while 110 may not seem much better than 100, if you keep growing at a rate of 10% per week you'll be amazed at how big the numbers will be. After one year you'll have 14,000 users, and after two years you'll have 2 million.
- The big danger is that you yourself will dismiss your startup.
- It is worth asking whether there is a subset of the market where a critical mass of users can be achieved quickly.
- Startups are not projectiles, instead they are more like propelled planes.
- The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.
- Don't let indecision stop you from making a decision, just make it and don't stop.
